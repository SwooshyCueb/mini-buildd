mini-buildd archive "%ID%"
==========================

This is the automatic archive keyring package for mini-buildd archive "%ID%".

APT "sources.list" library
--------------------------

This package also includes::

	/usr/share/mini-buildd/sources.list.d/

which has one file for any APT line available in this
repository, using this::

	CODENAME_ARCHIVE_REPOSITORY_SUITE[-rollbackN][_src].list

naming scheme.

This means you can easily select any available APT source via
symlinks in "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/".

.. note::

	 These sources will only work out of the box if you
	 have network access to archive "%ID%".

	 I.e., you will still need to fiddle your own in case you are
	 using a mirror.
