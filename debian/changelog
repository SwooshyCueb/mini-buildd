mini-buildd (0.6.6~ui40+1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * control: Depend on mini-dinstall >> 0.6.23 (ui-etch-bpo available). Fixes
    @todo [mini-dinstall] Allow apt-get update during index generation: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=324855 (NMU fix unstable).
  * cron: Send output of nightly updates to configured mail address. Fixes
    @todo cron: MAILTO (?).
  * sbuild: Set sbuild_mode to user; simplifies error handling in "build" qa test.

mini-buildd (0.6.5~ui40+1) etch-ui; urgency=low

  * Fix: Add verify_sigs = 0 to .mini-dinstall.conf (defaults to 1 when debian-keyring package
    is installed; we don't want this enabled ever at the moment.
  * Fix: Ignoring lintian error "no-description-in-changes-file": since dpkg 1.4.16: Changes
    files in source only uploads have no description field any more.

mini-buildd (0.6.4~ui40+1) etch-ui; urgency=low

  * Per dist, add new distribution "*-experimental". This ist NOT staging,
    but really just yet another repository. Packages uploaded to experimental
    will always stay there, seperately; it just uses the same framework
    to build packages, a new upload to "*" is needed to get it to the
    actual distribution.
    Note that *-experimental distributions can not yet satisfy build-deps
    from themselves.
  * Smaller enhancements:
    - In mails, always give distribution; most notably, to see what packages
      are uploaded to experimental.
    - mdb-setup-chroots: Change chroot fs type to ext2 (was ext3 ?!);
      we really have no need for journalling here. May speed up things
      somewhat.
    - *-bld/debconf: Put mirror and lvm setup items to high prio (was
      medium); you almost always want to change these.
  * Bug fixes:
    - mbd-update-rep-html, mbd-update-bld: Make some logger lines
      that may have empty args not wait on input. Fixes some update
      scripts just idling around (under sid's logger version).
    - schroot.conf: Increase snapshot size to 4G (was 2G). This will
      workaround the phenomena described in
      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471545

mini-buildd (0.6.0) sid-ui; urgency=low

  * Milestone 0.6 summary (see other cl entries for encrypted details):
    o Fully automatic "lvm via loop device" configuration option
      This greatly eases the setup and maintentence of test systems or
      systems w/o "proper" pre-setup lvm.
    o Thorough script cleanup; user visible changes:
      - All scripts prefixed w/ "mbd-" to avoid namespace pollution when
        adding the library to PATH.
      - All scripts using a getopt library, proper command line arguments
        and a usage help (via -h).
    o Complete new scheme for the autobuild processing:
      Everything* that is done during the autobuild process is a QA-Check
      on a debian changes file, resulting each in 0=FINE, 1=WARN or 2=FAIL
      status code and a log file (* i.e., a build run on arch X is also just
      a QA-Check).
      If any of the QA checks in the sequence results in "FAIL", the autobuild
      run is stopped. If no check results in FAIL, the status is 0=BUILT; if
      the failing check was a build check, the autobuild run status is 1=FTBFS,
      else 2=REJECT.
      The overall status mail's subject now always reflect this (e.g.
      "FTBS: mypkg_1.2.3-1"); in the body, information adapted to the
      respective status is delivered. No log output is pasted here
      directly any more but, if needed, links to repective QA check logs
      on the repository host.
      Binary uploads are just installed quietly unless they don't originate
      from mini-buildd autobuilder hosts; then, the special status "DISCARD"
      is used.
      Build run statuses overview:
       - BUILT  : OK=Source package build, binary packages uploaded.
       - FTBFS  : Problems building, but retrying later.
       - REJECT : Unfixable errors, upload moved to REJECT/.
       - DISCARD: Binary upload not allowed, upload removed.
       - INTERNAL: Indicates a bug in mini-buildd or its setup.
    o New QA checks:
      - New: Check that the to-build source package is not already in repository.
      - Orig: Warn on reupload, reject on different files.
    o New file and directory layout:
      On build hosts, we only have directories "chroots/" (for auto lvm
      setup when used) and "builds/" under bld/.
      "builds/" is used as location for temporary build directories;
      nothing is stored permanently on bld hosts any more (even the orig tarball
      is copied on demand from the repository).
      All actual data (log and state of check runs) of an autobuild run is hold on
      the repository host only in the new directory "log"; under that dir, the
      data is hold in a structure PACKAGE/VERSION/UTC-STAMP/.
    o All qa-checks run on all bld hosts are now run in parallel.
      .......................................................
              Details below
  * -bld: New directory "bld/chroots/"; this is for all chroot-related

mini-buildd (0.5.0) etch-mini-buildd; urgency=low

  * "Milestone" (0.4->0.5): This release basically adds more QA:
     - Adopting versioning scheme from bpo; packages not complying are
       rejected.
     - Direct binary uploads (i.e., not from mini-buildd) are detected
       and rejected.
     - Packages w/ lintian errors now fail to build (and are not installed).
     This release also fixes a lot of pending smaller todos in one go (see cl).
  * update-rep-html: Show mandatory version part per dist.

    are copied now and need to be synced if needed.
  * update-bld: Rename file for extra sources.
  * update-rep: Configure rep w/ keep_old = 1 again (not the reason sbuild fails sometimes).
  * -bld: debconf templates: Add descriptions for all items.

mini-buildd (0.4.0) etch-mini-buildd; urgency=low

  * "Milestone" (0.3->0.4): This release moves the actual "autobuild" part
    from mini-dinstalls postinstall to the preinstall, and copies DSP rather
    than relying on the repository itself to have them installed; this fixes
    various pending problems:
     - No need to have a (guessed) timeout waiting for indexes to be updated
       before auto-building.
     - No installation on the actual repository until all configured archs are
       successfully build.
     - Works around sbuild's "sporadically not updating package list"
       behaviour.
    This release also uses reniced logging throughout all scripts (see daemon.log),
    improved error handling (logs mailed on failure) and the ability to configure
    specific mirrors for base distributions (sarge/amd64 problem).
  * Cosmetic fixes for logging and mail.

  * preinstall: Until we have a better solution: Don't build parallel, fail if one build fails.
  * preinstall/update-bld: scp DSP, don't rely on a deb-src line in build chroot;
    also obsoletes sleep before build runs.
  * Add extra build script.
  * preinstall: Change build logic: 1st, build for all archs; if all were successfull,
    upload all archs and return success.
  * Only one error mail per source, including proper logs now in the body.

    configuration.
  * -bld config: Update mbd_debian_mirror to have a default mirror plus specific
    mirrors per dist if needed.
  * Logging: All scripts now use logging for informational output; logs for

  * update-bld: Update chroots: Use pipe to schroot rather than different calls
    (significant speed improvemnet); further refine error handling.
