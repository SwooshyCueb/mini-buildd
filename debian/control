Description: minimal Debian build daemon - builder
 Mini-buildd is an easy-to-configure Debian autobuilder and
 repository. Its general notion is that of add-ons for a Debian
 base distribution (like etch, lenny, or sid) with an emphasis

 .
 This package equips a machine to act as a builder for a specific
 architecture. Before builders can be set up a repository host
 must be fully configured (see the package mini-buildd-rep).
