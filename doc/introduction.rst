**mini-buildd** is a custom build daemon for *Debian*-based
distributions with *all batteries included*: I.e., it covers
**incoming**, **(distributed) building**, **installing**,
**repository maintenance** and **repository delivery**.

Main Components

mini-buildd does not re-invent the wheel, it's rather a
sophisticated glue written in `python
<http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/python.html>`_ to a number of
standard (Debian) or off-the-shelf software components. The most
prominent parts are:

********
Features
********

*Core features*:

* Integrated **HTTP server** (webapp and repository delivery).
* Integrated **FTP server** (incoming).
* **Web-based configuration**, with integrated managing of chroots and repositories.
* **Distributed builders**.
* **Web-based** or **command line** repository maintenance via *API* calls.

*Some prominent extras*:

* *mini-buildd-tool*: Use from the command line, write scripts.
* *User management*: Package subscriptions, GPG key management, upload authorization.
* *Package QA*: Internal sanity checks, version enforcing, lintian.
* *Package Tracking*: ``Debian PTS``-like web based source package tracker.
* *No-Changes-Ports*: Automates these ports for internal or external source packages.
* *Rollback handling*: Keeps ``N`` rollbacks for any distribution.
* *Builds keyring packages* automatically.


The :doc:`todo` section may also help you to figure out what
mini-buildd is not, or not yet.

.. _introduction_use_cases:

*****************
Example Use Cases
*****************

* *Sandboxing*: Just setup a default ``test`` (sandbox)  repository:
	* Test-drive mini-buildd. Click schlimm on the WebApp.
	* Checkout what No-Changes-Ports are possible.
	* Add a fake user as admin, and spam a collegue with mini-buildd status mails.
* *Debian User*: Maintain a personal package archive. Publish it to your webspace via debmirror.
* *Debian Developer*: Replace your pbuilder setup.
* *Organisation*: Set up an archive for all organisational extra packages, ports, etc.


.. _introduction_overview:

***********************
Basic Mode Of Operation
***********************

**mini-buildd** is a Unix daemon written in python. When
running, it provides a HTTP server (on port ``8066`` by default).

The HTTP server serves both, mini-buildd's web application as
well as the delivery of the package repositories.

The instance is being configured in the configuration section of
the web application.

As soon as a *mini-buildd* instance has been configured to have
an active 'Daemon', you may ``start`` the engine, running an FTP
server (on port ``8067`` by default).

The FTP server acts on incoming ``*.changes`` files, both from
developers and other mini-buildd instances (via special
``buildrequest`` and ``buildresult`` changes).

As soon as an instance of *mini-buildd* has active chroots
configured, it acts as *builder*. Chroots are completely generic
and interchangeable, and identified by *codename* and *arch*
only; distribution-specific build configuration is all carried
through the internal buildrequests. Thus, *mini-buildd*
instances may be interconnected as so-called 'Remotes' to share
builders.

This is a simplified example mini-buildd 'network' with three
mini-buildd instances *ernie*, *grover* and *bert*:

* *ernie* has repositories and chroots, and uses himself and *grover* as remote for building.
* *grover* only has chroots, and is used by *ernie* and *bert* for building.
* *bert* only has repositories, and uses *ernie* and *grover* as remotes for building.
