Bugs/Caveats:
=============
@todo Incoming/upload: Parallel uploads of the same package (e.g. for etch-* and sarge-* at the same time) may overwrite each other

Mini-dinstall fixes:
====================
@bug [mini-dinstall] Only keeps changes file from latest installed architecture (Uploads: source, amd64, i386 => only i386 stays in repo).
@todo [mini-dinstall] Error mails should not have python exception text, but be human-readable.
@todo [mini-dinstall] Should include script output for pre/postinstall on error mails (we can then cleanup hook scripts).
@todo [mini-dinstall] Allow parallel builds of different uploaded packages.
@todo [mini-dinstall] New release directory layout: "mbd": My current best plan is:
                      DIST-ID/SRC_PKG/       : All packages of that source package (the actual files, somewhat like a package pool diectory).
                      DIST-ID/SRC_PKG/stable/: All stable-tagged packages of that source package.
                      DIST-ID/               : All packages repo; symlinks to all files ../SRC_PKG/*.
                      DIST-ID/stable/        : Stable repo; Symlinks to all files ../SRC_PKG/stable/* of all packages.
Features:
=========
@todo [brain] Make sbuild apt_allow_unauthenticated configurable via debconf; add some
      infrastructure to add keys when entering chroots, and some way to manage keys.
@todo [brain] PMS (Package Maintenance System) via web interface.
   - Overview/startup page:
     - Information on current overview page.
     - Package search.
     - Wishlist: Global package maintenance.
   - Per (source) package view
     - Download links, apt source lines.
     - Show all versions of that package.
     - Propose a version to stable.
     - Degrade a version to unstable.
     - Ancient versions maintenance.
@todo [rfc] Package groups (do we need them still?).
@todo [rfc] Lintian check: We currently use the lintian check from the
      lintian version of the base distribution to build for. Maybe its better to just use
      a recent version on the system.
      + technically much simpler to implement;
      + better for "backport-like" packages;
      + get lintian bug fixes;
      + defined version of lintian, use all features;
      - maybe not conform to policy version of base dist.

Wishlist:
=========
@todo [deb] apache2/httpd: Assure user_dir support?

Later:
======
@todo Support for more than one id in one mini-buildd network.
@todo Some "auto-backport" mechanism for packages known to need no changes would be nice.
@todo [brain] Package rebuild feature (needs: package maintenance first).
