This manual page only describes the call syntax of the
mini-buildd program, which you will only really need for
fine-tuning, debugging or testing.

End-users usually just go with the online manual, which is
always available through mini-buildd's web interface. In a
standard install, it's available at

.B http://localhost:8066/manual/index.html.
