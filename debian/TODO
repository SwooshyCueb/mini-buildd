======================================================================
Old buglist for 0.8.x (for later review)
======================================================================

Bugs/Caveats:
=============
@todo httpd: On fresh installs (at least for apache2): No user
   dir support (but we need it).
@todo Incoming/upload: Parallel uploads of the same package
   (e.g. for etch-* and sarge-* at the same time) may overwrite
   each other
@todo -experimental, any: (think) Prevent upload of version
   already uploaded.
@todo auto-backport queue: Only triggered by new uploads that
   trigger preinstall. Ideally fixed in mini-dinstall; maybe
   cron workaround as long as we use it unchanged still.

Mini-dinstall quirks: (wontfix for 0.8.x, 0.9.x will use reprepro)
=====================
@bug [mini-dinstall] 0.6.25 does not keep the source.changes file in repo with keep=0 (experimental distributions).
@todo [mini-dinstall] Error mails should not have python exception text, but be human-readable.
@todo [mini-dinstall] Should include script output for pre/postinstall on error mails (we can then cleanup hook scripts).
@todo [mini-dinstall] Allow parallel builds of different uploaded packages.

Features:
=========
@todo [brain] PMS (Package Maintenance System) via web interface.
   - Overview/startup page:
     - Information on current overview page.
     - Package search.
     - Wishlist: Global package maintenance.
   - Per (source) package view
     - Download links, apt source lines.
     - Show all versions of that package.
     - Propose a version to stable.
     - Degrade a version to unstable.
     - Ancient versions maintenance.
@todo [rfc] Package groups (do we need them still?).
@todo [rfc] Manual staging.
@todo [rfc] Lintian check: We currently use the lintian check from the
      lintian version of the base distribution to build for. Maybe its better to just use
      a recent version on the system.
      + technically much simpler to implement;
      + better for "backport-like" packages;
      + get lintian bug fixes;
      + defined version of lintian, use all features;
      - maybe not conforming to policy version of base dist.
@todo [rfc] Allow binary uploads for convenience (throwing uploaded binaries away).

Later:
======
@todo Support for more than one id in one mini-buildd network.
@todo [brain] Package rebuild feature (needs: package maintenance first).
