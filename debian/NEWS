mini-buildd (1.0.0~alpha.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * An 0.8.x (mini-dinstall/flat/multipackage) repository cannot be (automatically)
  migrated into a new 1.0 (reprepro/pool/migration one). If you have upgraded from
  0.8.x, your complete "old" repository will still be accessible like before (you
  can not build for it anymore, though).

  It's recommendend to just keep the old repository (located in '$HOME/rep/*') as-is,
  and use it as "Source" in your new (replacing) 1.0.0 setup (located in
  '$HOME/repositories/*').

  Advanced users or purists may think about manually migrating packages to the new
  1.0 setup manually using reprepro at some point.
