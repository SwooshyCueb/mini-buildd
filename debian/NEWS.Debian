mini-buildd-rep (0.8.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple sources are no longer separated via literal "\n", but now
    via ",". There is no automatic upgrade path for this.

    Those who actually have multiple sources defined via "\n" separator
    (mbd_src_* config variables in ~mini-buildd/.mini-buildd.conf) need
    'dpkg-reconfigure mini-buildd-rep', and check their configuration.

    Compare Bug #625995.
